## Replacing proxies.txt
Download this:

https://github.com/jimboy3100/jimboy3100.github.io/raw/master/ExampleScripts/agario-bots2/agario-bots-proxies/Gather_Proxy_9.0_Premium.zip

The above program is for replacing proxies.txt

USE ALWAYS VPN AND CONNECT ONLY TO SOCK5 SOCKETS (SAFEST)

YOU ARE NOT SAFE IF USING PROXIES AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS THING WORKS

On Gather Proxy -> Proxy Checker -> Choose only SOCK5 (it takes 30 min)
Export at least 1000 ALIVE proxies (not less), see the generated file and replace everything on proxies.txt after # SOCKS5

You can also find proxy bots IPs from https://discord.gg/YkyS8zd , room #free-bots-proxies-ðŸ”¨

** If you use Repl.it, and it is connected to proxies, in theory users can be safe even with SOCK4, but they are recommended not to use other than SOCK5, also SOCK5 expire later and hide IP and countries.

### GOOD LUCK!
